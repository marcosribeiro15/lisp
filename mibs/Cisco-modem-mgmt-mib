                    offHook: The condition similar to picking up a telephone
                    receiver to dial or answer a call.

                    connected: The modem is in a state when it can transmit or
                    receive data over the communications line.

                    busiedOut: The modem is busied out (i.e. taken out of

                    This state can be set and clear via cmHoldReset.

                    bad: The modem is suspected or proven to be bad.  The
                    operator can take the modem out of service and mark
                    the modem as 'bad' via cmBad.

                    loopback: The modem is in a state where it is currently
                    running back-to-back loopback testing.

                    currently downloading the firmware.
